Run this project using $python3 main

Move your mouse around the viewing winddow and watch the orange dots dance among the others.

Then go into the code, and in main.py change the last line from main(with_colisions = False) to main(with_colisions = True).

Run the code again and watch what happends when dots collide.

Nou can chase after dots and make them change color!
